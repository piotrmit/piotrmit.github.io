	abstract = {Binary sphere packings with a density greater than that of phase-separated face-centered cubic (fcc) packings are important structural candidates for the self-assembly of mixtures of stabilized, hard, spherical particles. Details are presented of an A3B binary hard sphere packing obtained by simulated annealing in an isopointal set 62cd/c. The structure has a higher density than all known others when the sphere radius ratio rA/rB is between 0.619 and 0.659786. This extends the known range over which compound binary sphere packings can exceed the density of phase-separated fcc packing. Previously, no packings were known to exceed this mark between a radius ratio of 0.62 and 1.0. The structure of interest has a peak density of 0.747857, which occurs at a radius ratio of 0.647989. A related dense packing is also discussed, which has a peak density of 0.7573 at a size ratio of 0.5147. This latter structure is the densest known noninterstitial compound packing when the mixture has three small spheres for every large sphere, at any size ratio. Both structures are likely candidates for stability in binary hard sphere phase diagrams at this composition, but neither has so far been observed experimentally.},

	abstract = {We numerically investigate colloidal dimers with asymmetric interaction strengths to study how the interplay between molecular geometry, excluded volume effects and attractive forces determines the overall phase behavior of such systems. Specifically, our model is constituted by two rigidly-connected tangent hard spheres interacting with other particles in the first instance via identical square-well attractions. Then, one of the square-well interactions is progressively weakened, until only the corresponding bare hard-core repulsion survives, giving rise to a “Janus dumbbell” model. We investigate structure, thermodynamics and phase behavior of the model by means of successive umbrella sampling and Monte Carlo simulations. In most of the cases, the system behaves as a standard simple fluid, characterized by a gas–liquid phase separation, for sufficiently low temperatures. In these conditions we observe a remarkable linear scaling of the critical temperature as a function of the interaction strength. But, as the interaction potential approaches the Janus dumbbell limit, we observe the spontaneous formation of self-assembled lamellar structures, preempting the gas–liquid phase separation. Comparison with previous studies allows us to pinpoint the role of the interaction range in controlling the onset of ordered structures and the competition between the formation of these structures and gas–liquid condensation.},

Here we extend our previous analysis by introducing in the model the size asymmetry of the hard-core diameters and study the enriched phase scenario thereby obtained. By employing standard Monte Carlo simulations we show that in such ‘heteronuclear Janus dumbbells’ a larger hard-sphere site promotes the formation of clusters, whereas in the opposite condition a gas–liquid phase separation takes place, with a narrow interval of intermediate asymmetries wherein the two phase behaviors may compete. In addition, some peculiar geometrical arrangements, such as lamellæ, are observed only around the perfectly symmetric case. A qualitative agreement is found with recent experimental results, where it is shown that the roughness of molecular surfaces in heterogeneous dimers leads to the formation of colloidal micelles.},

	abstract = {We investigate the fluid structure and self-assembly of a system of Janus dumbbells by means of aggregation-volume-bias Monte Carlo simulations and Simulated Annealing techniques. In our approach, Janus dumbbells model asymmetric colloidal particles constituted by two tangent (touching) spheres (labelled as h and s) of different sizes and interaction properties: specifically, the h spheres interact with all other spheres belonging to different dumbbells via hard-sphere potentials, whereas two s spheres interact via a square-well potential. By introducing a parameter α ∈ [0,2] that controls the size ratio between the h and s spheres, we are able to investigate the overall phase behaviour of Janus dumbbells as a function of α. In a previous paper (O'Toole et al., Soft Matter, 2017, 13, 803) we focused on the region where the s sphere is larger than the h sphere (α {\textgreater} 1), documenting the presence of a variety of phase behaviours. Here we investigate a different regime of size ratios, predominantly where the hard sphere is larger than (or comparable to) the attractive one. Under these conditions, we observe the onset of many different self-assembled super-structures. Depending on the specific value of α we document the presence of spherical clusters (micelles) progressively evolving into more exotic structures including platelets, filaments, networks and percolating fluids, sponge structures and lamellar phases. We find no evidence of a gas–liquid phase separation for α ≤ 1.1, since under these conditions it is pre-empted by the development of self-assembled phases.},

Here we present a theoretical model which is applied to capture the heat evolution and accumulation during laser direct energy deposition and laser powder bed fusion processes. Infrared imaging from literature is used to validate the model. The model captures the effect of the consecutive deposition of the individual layers and shows its influence on heat accumulation. It demonstrates that heat accumulation leads to noticeable change in local solidification rate and temperature gradient, which results in significant variation in local grain structure. The predictions of the model allows for the development of process optimization strategies for the control of local microstructure evolution.},

The first sphere (h) interacts with all other spheres belonging to different dumbbells with a hard-sphere potential. The second sphere (s) interacts via a square-well interaction with other s spheres belonging to different dumbbells and with a hard-sphere potential with all remaining h spheres. We focus on the region where the s sphere is larger than the h sphere, as measured by a parameter 1 ≤ α ≤ 2 controlling the relative size of the two spheres. As α → 2 a simple fluid of square-well spheres is recovered, whereas α → 1 corresponds to the Janus dumbbell limit, where the h and s spheres have equal sizes. Many phase diagrams falling into three classes are observed, depending on the value of α. The 1.8 ≤ α ≤ 2 is dominated by a gas–liquid phase separation very similar to that of a pure square-well fluid with varied critical temperature and density. When 1.3 ≤ α ≤ 1.8 we find a progressive destabilization of the gas–liquid phase diagram by the onset of self-assembled structures, that eventually lead to a metastability of the gas–liquid transition below α = 1.2.},

	abstract = {The energy used to melt the material at each layer during laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) accumulates in the solidified layers upon layer deposition and leads to an increase in the temperature of the part with an increasing number of layers. This heat accumulation can lead to inhomogeneous solidification conditions, increasing residual stresses and potentially anisotropic mechanical properties due to columnar grain structures. In this work, infrared imaging is applied during the directed energy deposition process to capture the evolution of the temperature field in high spatial and temporal evolutions. Image processing algorithms determined the solidification rate and the temperature gradient in the spatial and temporal evolutions and evidenced their change with the proceeding deposition process. Metallographic analysis proves that these changes significantly affect the local grain structure of the L-DED fabricated parts. The study provides comprehensive quantitative measurements of the change in the solidification variables in local and temporal resolutions. The comprehensive comparison of different parameter combinations reveals that applied power, and especially the frequency of the consecutive deposition of the individual layers, are the key parameters to adjusting heat accumulation. These findings provide a methodology for optimising L-DED manufacturing processes and tailoring the local microstructure development by controlling heat accumulation.},

This study proposes a simulation framework for predicting the microstructure and corresponding meso- and macro-scale properties of AM materials. This is achieved by integrating phase-field and crystal plasticity modelling techniques, whereby the phase field model predicts the microstructure and the crystal plasticity constitutive model computes the stress–strain evolution using the microstructure as the input. The simulation of multiple microstructures demonstrates that this integrated approach can be used to test the influence of different microstructures on the mechanical properties of titanium alloy Ti-5553. This includes the influence of grain size and grain orientation on both the meso- and macro-scale behaviour.},

	abstract = {The flexibility of additive manufacturing processes results from the principle of subsequently adding small amounts of material in individual layers or beads on top of each other. The periodic input of energy required to melt the material can lead to an accumulation of heat, which increases the temperature of the part and changes the local temperature distribution in the melt pool. This heat accumulation results in local shape deviations of the part and can lead to inhomogeneous solidification conditions coinciding with inhomogeneous grain structures and potentially inhomogeneous mechanical properties or build failures. To produce high quality parts with homogeneous properties and to reduce unproductive dwell times, a comprehensive knowledge of the heat accumulation phenomena is required. The present work considers an explicit analytical description of the heat accumulation effect, which allows for a mathematical analysis of the influence of all contributing process parameters on the temperature increase of the part. The analytical equations were derived from simplified heat conduction equations and validated by comparison with temperature measurements from literature. The calculated temperature increase shows a good agreement with measurements observed during additive manufacturing of different materials and alloys in case of cladding or building volumes with direct energy deposition (DED) and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Finally, the obtained analytical solution is used to derive optimization strategies aiming to reduce heat accumulation while simultaneously increasing productivity.},

	abstract = {At present, most multiscale simulation approaches to model the temperature evolution of the molten pool, and the resulting microstructure evolution for selective laser melting, assume an equilibrium freezing range and steady state solidification conditions. This is despite the solidification conditions being observed to be highly unsteady and non-equilibrium. These two assumptions lead to inaccurate predictions of the temperature evolution of the molten pool and thus microstructure predictions. To demonstrate this, an approach to scale-bridging computational models of the laser additive manufacturing process is presented, in which the temperature history is passed from a macroscale molten pool simulation to a microscale phase-field simulation. This linkage is achieved by volume mapping of the temperature field from the grid of the molten pool simulation to the grid of the microstructure simulation. To describe the system evolution at the scale of the molten pool, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method that captures the laser–metal interaction, vapour production, gas recoil pressure, fluid flow, surface tension, Marangoni flow, and heat conduction, convection, and radiation is applied. To capture the chemical kinetics of the phase-transition, a non-equilibrium CALPHAD-integrated phase-field (PF) model is applied. The discrepancy between the predictions of the solid front isotherm is quantified as ⩾100K for an Al-10Si alloy under the large observed cooling rate. This leads to a spatial discrepancy in the solidification front between the CFD model, which assumes equilibrium freezing behaviour, and the PF model, which does not, of approximately 10µm over 50µs in the present case. Under these conditions, present formulations of multiphase CFD cannot accurately predict the solidification behaviour because of the assumption of equilibrium at the solid–liquid interface. Strategies for reconciling this discrepancy for materials that exhibit rapid solidification under large thermal undercooling will need to be developed for multiscale simulation of additive manufacturing to advance.},

It has witnessed substantial growth both in terms of techniques and materials in recent years. In the previous chapters, various techniques for metal additive manufacturing have been described along with their current standards and practices. In this chapter, we focus our attention on wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), which is a type of directed energy deposition (DED) AM process as outlined in ISO/ASTM 52900:2015 [1]. In WAAM, an electric or plasma arc is used as the heat source to melt a wire feedstock, which results in fusion with the previously deposited layers, thus building up material in the process. Compared to other AM methods, the advantages of WAAM are a higher productivity rate, the ability to manufacture large components, and the ready availability, lower cost, and handling safety of the welding wire compared to the powder feedstock. Applications of WAAM already exist in the automotive, space and aeronautics, and shipping industries, where the use of light metals is common.},

The cumulative heat input, which results from the subsequent addition of individual layers, leads to a continuous temperature change with proceeding build progress. In order to access a comprehensive investigation of this effect, the process was analysed by infrared imaging in spatial and temporal resolution. The present work describes an image based processing method, to monitor the process zone of the L-DED process. The algorithm detects the point in time, when the process zone is present in the field of view of the infrared camera, and determines the current location of the melt pool and the solidification zone. The captured isotherms determine the change of the temperature field in case of L-DED-manufacturing with different process parameters. Finally, the local solidification rates and temperature gradients were deduced from the geometry and position of the captured isotherms. The comparison of spatial distribution of these solidification conditions highlights the significant influence of the process parameters on solidification in L-DED.},
