I am a chemist-engineer-developer with an interest in computational materials science, machine learning, and additive manufacturing. I am currently a Research Fellow at the [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) in Melbourne, Australia. I am a member of the [Centre for Additive Manufacturing](https://www.rmit.edu.au/research/centres-collaborations/centre-for-additive-manufacturing) and the [ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre for Surface Engineering and Advanced Materials (ARC ITTC SEAM)](https://arcseam.com.au/). 

I am currently working on developing tools for modelling various physical phenomena that occur during additive manufacturing using a combination of commercial, open-source, and in-house developed software. I am proficient in the use of C/C++, Python, and Fortran programming languages.
